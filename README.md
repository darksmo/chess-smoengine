Simple Chess Engine

Still in development during my free time, a chess engine with a simple
interface that can be easily integrated in your own C chess program.

Features currently implemented:
- simple tests for bitboards, placement of pieces
- create bitboards out of your own representation of a chessboard
- basic, not yet optimised bitboard infrastructure to represent a chessboard
 * (incomplete) kings movements/attacks
 * knight movements/attacks
